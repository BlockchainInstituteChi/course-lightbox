## Lightbox for Courses Pages

This library compiles a .min.js file which handles the display and control of a lightbox which is embedded on our courses pages. The goal of this product is to ask users to create an account without being too obtrusive. 

The raw src of the library is contained in the src/ directory.

To build the src to a production file, run build.sh. You must first run npm install --save-dev tinyify to configure npm properly.
